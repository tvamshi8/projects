Customer lifetime value analysis is used to estimate the total value of customers to the business over the lifetime of their relationship. It helps companies determine how much to invest in customer acquisition and retention, as well as identify the most valuable customers to prioritize for retention efforts.
By analyzing customer lifetime value, companies can identify the most effective marketing channels and campaigns for acquiring high-value customers, as well as develop targeted retention strategies to keep those customers engaged and loyal.

For the Customer Lifetime Value analysis task, we need a dataset based on customers’ relationships with the business. Dataset for this task is available in the repository

The dataset look like this;
   customer_id           channel       cost  conversion_rate  revenue
0            1          referral   8.320327         0.123145     4199
1            2  paid advertising  30.450327         0.016341     3410
2            3   email marketing   5.246263         0.043822     3164
3            4      social media   9.546326         0.167592     1520
4            5          referral   8.320327         0.123145     2419

Let’s start by visualizing the distribution of acquisition cost and revenue generated by the customer using histograms:
